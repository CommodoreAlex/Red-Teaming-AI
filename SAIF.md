# Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) and its Approach to AI Security

Google’s Secure AI Framework (SAIF) offers an extensive, holistic approach to AI security, expanding on established frameworks like OWASP by addressing security risks across the entire AI lifecycle. From data collection to model deployment, SAIF provides guidelines to ensure secure AI application development, emphasizing the integration of security and privacy considerations from the start.

## SAIF Framework Overview

The framework is organized into four distinct areas of secure AI development, each covering essential components necessary for secure AI applications:

### 1. **Data**
The data area focuses on the management and processing of the data that feeds into AI models. This includes data sources, filtering, and preprocessing, as well as the selection and management of training data. It ensures that the data used is clean, verified, and ethically sourced, reducing the risks of biases and vulnerabilities.

### 2. **Infrastructure**
This area is concerned with the hardware and underlying infrastructure that supports AI systems, including storage solutions, the platforms used for model development, and the tools used for deployment. The components include:
- Model frameworks and code
- Training, tuning, and evaluation processes
- Data and model storage
- Model deployment (Model Serving)

### 3. **Model**
This is the core component of any AI system, dealing with the actual machine learning models used for predictions. The security of models is paramount, ensuring that they remain robust against tampering, reverse engineering, or exploitation. It includes:
- Model creation
- Input handling
- Output handling

### 4. **Application**
The application area focuses on how AI models interact with end-users or other systems. It covers both the AI deployment’s front-end interfaces and potential agents or plugins interacting with the model.

## Key Security Risks in SAIF

SAIF outlines specific security risks that might arise within each component. These risks often overlap with those described in OWASP’s ML Top 10 or LLM Top 10 but are tailored to a broader context of AI security. Here are the key risks identified in SAIF:

### Data Risks
- **Data Poisoning**: Attackers inject malicious or misleading data into the model’s training set, potentially compromising performance or creating vulnerabilities.
- **Unauthorized Training Data**: The model might be trained on unauthorized or unethical data, leading to legal, ethical, or security concerns.

### Model Risks
- **Model Source Tampering**: Attackers could manipulate the model’s source code or weights to alter its behavior or create vulnerabilities.
- **Model Exfiltration**: Unauthorized access to the model itself could result in the theft of intellectual property.
- **Model Reverse Engineering**: Through careful analysis, attackers could reverse-engineer the model to gain insight into proprietary details or extract sensitive information.

### Infrastructure Risks
- **Model Deployment Tampering**: Attackers could target the model deployment process, compromising its integrity or functionality.
- **Denial of ML Service**: Attackers overload the model with malicious inputs to disrupt or deny service.

### Application Risks
- **Prompt Injection**: Malicious actors could manipulate the inputs to the model, triggering harmful or unintended behaviors.
- **Model Evasion**: Subtle alterations to inputs can lead the model to make incorrect predictions or decisions.
- **Sensitive Data Disclosure**: Attackers might extract sensitive information from the model’s outputs, either by direct querying or inference.

## SAIF Risk Mitigation Controls

To mitigate these risks, SAIF outlines a set of controls aimed at securing each area of AI development. The responsibility for applying these controls typically lies with either the model creator or the model consumer. Below are some of the controls described in SAIF:

### Input and Output Validation
- **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Detect and block malicious queries or inputs before they are processed by the model.
    - **Risk Mapping**: Prompt Injection
    - **Implemented by**: Model Creators, Model Consumers
- **Output Validation and Sanitization**: Validate or sanitize model output before processing by the application.
    - **Risk Mapping**: Prompt Injection, Rogue Actions, Sensitive Data Disclosure, Inferred Sensitive Data
    - **Implemented by**: Model Creators, Model Consumers

### Adversarial Training and Testing
- **Adversarial Training**: Train the model on adversarial inputs to strengthen resilience against attacks.
    - **Risk Mapping**: Model Evasion, Prompt Injection, Sensitive Data Disclosure, Inferred Sensitive Data, Insecure Model Output
    - **Implemented by**: Model Creators, Model Consumers

## SAIF Risk Map

The Risk Map is the central SAIF component encompassing information about components, risks, and controls in a single place. It provides an overview of the different components interacting in an AI application, the risks that arise in each component, and how to mitigate them. Furthermore, the map provides information about where a security risk is introduced (risk introduction), where the risk may be exploited (risk exposure), and where a risk may be mitigated (risk mitigation).
