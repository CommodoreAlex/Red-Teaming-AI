# Introduction to Red Teaming ML-based Systems

## Overview

This repository focuses on Red Teaming Machine Learning (ML)-based systems to assess their security. Red Teaming simulates real-world attacks to test the resilience of an organization's defenses, including people, processes, and technology. Unlike traditional Penetration Testing, which targets specific vulnerabilities, Red Teaming provides a comprehensive assessment across all layers of security.

In the context of ML-based systems, security challenges arise due to their complexity, including large datasets, statistical inference, and model architectures. This repository explores how traditional Red Teaming techniques can be adapted to uncover vulnerabilities in AI and ML systems, such as data poisoning, model inversion, and adversarial attacks.

## Objectives

This project aims to:  
1. Identify unique vulnerabilities in ML systems.  
2. Apply Red Teaming techniques to assess these vulnerabilities.  
3. Share practical insights and strategies for securing AI systems based on lessons learned.  

## Inspiration  

Inspired by Hack The Boxâ€™s **AI Red Teamer Path**, this project leverages hands-on techniques to understand and mitigate the security risks of ML systems. The goal is to document and share the process of securing AI models through real-world adversarial methods.
