## Attacking Application Components

The application component of a machine learning (ML)-based system closely mirrors traditional systems in terms of security vulnerabilities, risks, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Generative AI systems are often integrated into traditional applications that interact with external networks and services like web applications, email systems, and other internal or external systems. Therefore, most traditional security risks apply to the application component of ML-based systems as well.

### Risks

1. **Unauthorized Application Access**: Unauthorized access to an application can occur when attackers gain entry to sensitive areas of the system without proper credentials. This can lead to:
   - Breaches of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
   - Access to administrative interfaces or sensitive data through the application's user interface.
   - Privilege escalation attacks, potentially leading to complete system compromise or data loss.

2. **Injection Attacks**: Injection attacks, such as SQL injection or command injection, exploit vulnerabilities in the application due to improper input handling and a lack of input sanitization. These attacks can manipulate back-end databases or system processes, often resulting in:
   - Data breaches.
   - Complete system compromise.
   
   For instance, a successful SQL injection attack could:
   - Retrieve sensitive user data.
   - Bypass authentication mechanisms.
   - Destroy databases.

   To learn more about these attack vectors, check out the **SQL Injection Fundamentals** and **Command Injections** modules.

3. **Insecure Authentication**: When authentication mechanisms (such as login pages or password management) are poorly designed or implemented, attackers can exploit them to gain unauthorized access. Common weaknesses include:
   - Weak passwords.
   - Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA).
   - Improper session token handling.
   
   Attackers could use brute-force methods or stolen credentials from phishing attacks to impersonate legitimate users. For more information on attacking insecure authentication mechanisms, refer to the **Broken Authentication** module.

4. **Information Disclosure**: Data leakage occurs when sensitive information is unintentionally exposed to unauthorized parties. This is typically due to:
   - Insecure coding practices.
   - Inadequate access controls.
   - Misconfigured databases.
   - Improper error handling.
   - Verbose logging.
   - Insecure data transmission.
   
   The consequences of data leakage can include privacy violations, financial losses, and reputational damage. Attackers may exploit leaked data for malicious purposes such as identity theft, fraud, or targeted phishing.

### Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)

Threat actors often exploit weak or nonexistent input validation mechanisms to inject malicious data or bypass security controls in application components. Here are some common TTPs:

1. **Input Field Manipulation**: Web applications often rely on input fields (forms, URLs, query parameters) to receive data from users. Attackers may:
   - Input unexpected data types.
   - Submit excessively long strings.
   - Encode characters to bypass validation rules.
   
   Encoding data (e.g., HTML encoding, URL encoding) or obfuscating payloads can allow attackers to bypass insufficient input validation mechanisms.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: In XSS attacks, adversaries inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These attacks take advantage of weak or missing input sanitization in user-generated content areas, such as comment sections or search bars. The most common TTPs for XSS attacks include:
   - Injecting JavaScript into input fields.
   - Displaying the code without proper validation.
   
   The injected code executes in the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
   - Stealing session tokens.
   - Redirecting users to phishing sites.
   - Manipulating the DOM to spoof UI elements.

   For more details, check out the **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** and **Advanced XSS and CSRF Exploitation** modules.

3. **Social Engineering Attacks**: Social engineering is the use of psychological manipulation to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. Common social engineering attack vectors include:
   - **Phishing**: Attackers impersonate trusted entities to steal sensitive data or credentials.
   - **Pretexting**: Adversaries create convincing scenarios to manipulate victims into revealing information, such as pretending to be IT support and requesting login credentials.
   - **Baiting**: Attackers distribute infected USB drives or fake downloads to lure victims into executing malware.

   Social engineering often serves as the first step in a broader campaign, helping attackers gain access to internal systems without breaching technical security measures.
