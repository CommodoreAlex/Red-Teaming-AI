# Attacking Text Generation LLMs: Security Vulnerabilities

When deploying systems powered by generative AI, especially Large Language Models (LLMs) used for text generation, various security vulnerabilities can emerge. In line with the OWASP guidelines, the OWASP has listed the **Top 10 Security Risks for LLM Applications**. These risks offer insights into potential threats that could arise in LLM-based systems. While some risks mirror common machine learning security issues, others are specific to the challenges of managing text generation models.

| ID    | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LLM01 | **Prompt Injection**: Attackers manipulate input to induce malicious behavior in the LLM.                                        |
| LLM02 | **Insecure Output Handling**: Poor handling of LLM output leads to vulnerabilities such as XSS or SQL injection.                 |
| LLM03 | **Training Data Poisoning**: Malicious modification of training data to compromise LLM performance or introduce backdoors.       |
| LLM04 | **Model Denial of Service**: Attackers send resource-consuming queries to disrupt service availability.                          |
| LLM05 | **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**: Weaknesses in the LLM supply chain, such as the training data, third-party models, or plugins. |
| LLM06 | **Sensitive Information Disclosure**: LLMs inadvertently reveal confidential data or sensitive information.                      |
| LLM07 | **Insecure Plugin Design**: Exploiting flaws in LLM plugins for various attack vectors such as XSS or Remote Code Execution.     |
| LLM08 | **Excessive Agency**: LLMs are granted more privileges than necessary, enlarging the attack surface.                             |
| LLM09 | **Overreliance**: An over-dependence on LLM-generated output without sufficient validation, leading to possible vulnerabilities. |
| LLM10 | **Model Theft**: Unauthorized access to the LLM model, leading to intellectual property theft or replication.                    |

## 1. Prompt Injection (LLM01)

Prompt injection is a security flaw where an attacker manipulates the input provided to the LLM. This can cause the LLM to produce unintended or harmful outputs, such as generating false information, offensive content, or violating legal restrictions. Moreover, prompt injection may also lead to unintended disclosures of sensitive data, especially if the LLM has been exposed to it during training (refer to LLM06).

## 2. Insecure Output Handling (LLM02)

LLM-generated text should be treated with the same caution as untrusted user input. When output from an LLM is not sanitized properly, it could introduce common vulnerabilities such as **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, **SQL injection**, or **Command Injection**. For instance, if the LLM’s output is used directly in database queries without validation, it may lead to attacks like SQL injection.

Example: An LLM generating an SQL query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'malicious_input';` could inadvertently lead to a **SQL injection attack**. 

## 3. Training Data Poisoning (LLM03)

Training data poisoning is the manipulation of the data used to train an LLM. By introducing malicious or biased data into the training process, attackers can corrupt the model’s behavior. This can lead to faulty decision-making or even introduce backdoors. Protecting the integrity of the training data is crucial for maintaining LLM security. Verification steps such as data sanitization and ensuring data sources are trustworthy are necessary to prevent these risks.

## 4. Model Denial of Service (LLM04)

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack on an LLM involves overwhelming the model with resource-intensive queries. This could lead to degraded service or total system outages. Since LLMs are computationally expensive to operate, attackers can craft specific inputs that cause excessive resource consumption. To mitigate this risk, input validation, rate limiting, and resource monitoring should be implemented.

## 5. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities (LLM05)

LLMs rely on various components, including pre-trained models, external plugins, and the datasets used for training. An attack targeting any part of this supply chain could introduce vulnerabilities. Whether it’s data leaks, intellectual property theft, or the exploitation of weaknesses in external modules, managing the integrity of the entire LLM supply chain is critical.

## 6. Sensitive Information Disclosure (LLM06)

LLMs may inadvertently leak sensitive information, especially if they have been trained on or exposed to confidential data. Attackers can exploit this by crafting inputs that prompt the LLM to reveal personal, business-critical, or proprietary information. Restricting the LLM's access to sensitive data and ensuring that its outputs do not disclose such information is vital for preventing data breaches.

## 7. Insecure Plugin Design (LLM07)

LLMs often rely on plugins for enhanced functionality, such as querying databases or integrating with other services. If these plugins do not validate or sanitize data received from the LLM, they can become vulnerable to common attacks like **XSS**, **SQL injection**, **SSRF**, and **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**. Ensuring proper validation of the LLM's output before it interacts with any external system is essential for securing plugins.

## 8. Excessive Agency (LLM08)

LLMs should be granted only the minimum privileges necessary for their operation. Allowing an LLM excessive access to databases, external systems, or internal processes can increase the attack surface. For example, if an LLM has unrestricted access to modify database entries, it could be exploited to execute malicious commands, such as **DELETE** or **INSERT** statements, if manipulated.

## 9. Overreliance (LLM09)

Over-relying on the output from an LLM without proper validation can lead to security risks. LLMs are not infallible and can provide false or misleading information. This is especially dangerous if LLM output is used in business-critical decisions or integrated into automated systems. Ensuring that LLM-generated output undergoes appropriate human oversight and verification before use is essential.

## 10. Model Theft (LLM10)

Model theft occurs when an attacker gains unauthorized access to the LLM’s parameters and weights, allowing them to replicate the model or offer similar services at a lower cost. To safeguard intellectual property, strong access control, authentication, and encryption measures are necessary to protect the LLM from unauthorized access.

## Conclusion

As the use of generative AI models like LLMs becomes more widespread, the potential security vulnerabilities increase. Addressing these risks requires implementing robust security practices, including data validation, access control, and regular auditing of systems interacting with LLMs. Awareness of the OWASP Top 10 LLM risks will help ensure that text generation models are deployed securely, reducing the chances of exploitation by malicious actors.
